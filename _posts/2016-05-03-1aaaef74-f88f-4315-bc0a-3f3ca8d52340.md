Each pair of Silent Disco headphones can switch between three channels. You can also control the volume on each headset. The headband will display either Red Green or Blue broadcasting which of the three stations you are listening to. If you desire to talk to someone simply remove the headphones and use a normal voice to communicate. At loud music festivals and inside nightclubs you have to yell in order to hear someone right in front of you. That is not the case during a Silent Disco. The event itself can be thrown just about anywhere too. Party outside with the elements instead of piling inside smoke filled rooms.
